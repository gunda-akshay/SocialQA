# Social IQA
Question Answering has become a widely researched problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Prior benchmarks focused on physical and taxonomic knowledge. This work addresses the Social Interaction Question Answering (Social IQA) problem, the ﬁrst large scale benchmark for commonsense reasoning about social situations. A major challenge in Social IQA is the matching of answers with respective questions. Textual entailment is a basic task in natural language processing. Most approaches for solving this problem use only the textual content present in training data. This work tackles the question answering with an external knowledge such as Wikipedia, which is extracted and a graph is created. We perform our experiments on the Social IQA Dataset , which has context, question and answers.
